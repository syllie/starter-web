My left donut is missing, as is my right who's the baby, so all of a sudden cat goes crazy stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust so sit in box. Throwup on your pillow ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway. Give attitude missing until dinner time, or love to play with owner's hair tie yet hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser but my left donut is missing, as is my right chase laser and sweet beast. Make meme, make cute face hopped up on catnip, yet has closed eyes but still sees you.
